# Day Planner

Week five homework, create a day planner using Jquery as well as your choice of moment.js, lexon, etc. For hours past, grey out the cells. For present, make it a certain color, and for future time make it a different cell color.

## My Thoughts

Again, my problem is thinking like a programmer. However I was nowhere near as frustrated with this one as I was the last one. I wanted to get the text boxes to perform the same way as the cells did for time change, but couldn't figure it out.

Everything works correctly and all instructions were completed.
